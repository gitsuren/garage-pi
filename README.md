### About
GaragePi is a simple application that uses a Raspberry Pi along with 
[socket.io](http://www.socket.io) and [node.js](http://nodejs.org) to toggle a 
garage door opener.

GaragePi provides a web interface to toggle a gpio pin to send voltage to a
garage door opener, effectively simulating a button press.
